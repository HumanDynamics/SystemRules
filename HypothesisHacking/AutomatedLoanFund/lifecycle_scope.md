**The Lifecycle of Revolving Loan Funds from Inception to Successful Dissolution**

* Originally this information was created at: https://github.com/HumanDynamics/RevolvingLoanHack/wiki/Scope-of-Automation

The following processes, events and components may be in scope of the initial project to use DevOps for data-driven Revolving Loan Funds on blockchain


## BLT: Business, Legal and Technical Life-Cycle Integration

* **DOCKER**: Use docker image to containerize the entire entity, business processes and legal procedures of the loan fund
* **VALCU.co**: Use Valcu.co to automatically create a valid legal business entity (corp or llc) with Delaware Secretary of State (once incorporation is complete, extend this for grabbing the tax ID and creating bank account to hold the fund using API with selected depository institution)
* **Web Banking**: Use and integrated automated decision processes of the fund with the API selected partner bank to transact authorized web-based disbursals and repayments and pay routine expenses to operate the fund 
* **GitHub**: Use GitHub for the code and integrate AWS image of pre-configured template-base software that is customized by/for those starting up the loan fund
* **Cloud**: Use image of working instance of AWS/Rackspace/Azure/CloudFoundry/etc server, data stores, rules-engine (BPML 2), normalized/consistent platform & services and apps for loan officers, staff and auditors as well as for external web-based front-facing mobile app for loan application and notices to applicants or borrowers; authoritative single data store to drive the entire financial entity and enable breakthrough business intelligence and operations optimization; integrations with external payment, accounting, marketing and other key business or legal services; 
* **Blockchain for Identity**: Use ConsenSys' UPort, Blockstack or other available API-based service for locating individual or organizational unique identifiers and other identity attributes (this person has a KYC-verified account, that organization has over $50,000 in checking acct, confirm current postal address, etc)
* **Blockchain for Distributed Ledger**: Use Tierion, (blocksign, etc) to ensure proof of key transactional events (eg loan application as received; loan contract and terms as agreed; fact that a loan was successfully paid off, etc) by entering a hash of the relevant record(s) on the Bitcoin and/or Ethereum public blockchains and including reference to the address of that entry in the legal and business documents of or sent to the parties
* **Regulatory Filings**: Use government agency API interfaces to integrate timely and accurate reports, filings and other communications with regulatory, oversight, tax, permit/license providing; employee/hr or other governmental and private organizations with oversight authority

## Key RLF Processes:

* Establish lending criteria
* Pre-screen all applicants
* Underwrite all loans
* Serve as your lending staff
* Present to loan committee
* Prepare & execute loan documents
* Conduct loan closings
* Disburse loan funds
* Service the loan portfolio
* Monitor collateral
* File reports to the EDC

## Common Procedures and Parameters

* Purpose of program
* Geographic area served
* Committee composition
* Loan review criteria and approval process
* Financing policies (size, rate, term, fees)
* Sample Committee Composition
* Two members appointed by the city
* Two members appointed by the county commissioners
* Economic development and/or chamber representative
* One accountant or CPA
* Two from the private sector lending community
* Three representing the low-to-moderate income population

## Key Steps: Phasing and Staging


* Research existing RLFâ€™s and compile samples of application forms, program guidelines, and other materials.
* Invite lenders and potential borrowers to participate in the design process.
* Establish the purpose of the RLF. This should include a needs assessment.
* Set the eligibility requirements for borrowers.
* Determine the allowed uses of funds as well as prohibited uses.
* Set a minimum and maximum amount for the loans.
* Decide if the loans must be matched by existing equity or other sources of funds.
* Determine the length of the loan term, which may vary based on the use of the loan. For example, the term for a loan to purchase equipment may be based on the life of the product while a loan for real estate may have a 15-year term.
* Establish an application fee, origination fee, and policies regarding closing costs. Define the default and delinquency terms.
* Decide if the interest rate will be variable or fixed and whether the rate will vary based on the project.
* Develop the loan application form. Create a short pre-application form or checklist to help borrowers determine if they are eligible.
* Set up a committee to review loan applications.
* Determine the administrative duties and staffing needs associated with the program.
* Promote the RLF and capitalize with funds from grants and individual donations.
* Provide loans and technical assistance to borrowers.

## Credit Union Correlary: The Charitable Donation Account 

(b)(1) Charitable contributions and donations. Charitable contributions and donations are gifts you provide to assist others through contributions of staff, equipment, money, or other resources. Examples of charitable contributions include donations to community groups, nonprofit organizations, other credit unions or credit union affiliated causes, political donations, as well as donations to create charitable foundations.

(2) Charitable donation accounts. A charitable donation account (CDA) is a hybrid charitable and investment vehicle, satisfying the conditions in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section, that you may fund as a means to provide charitable contributions and donations to qualified charities. If you fund a CDA that satisfies all of the conditions in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section, then you may do so free from the investment limitations of the Federal Credit Union Act and part 703 of this chapter.

(i) Maximum aggregate funding. The book value of your investments in all CDAs, in the aggregate, as carried on your statement of financial condition prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, must be limited to 5 percent of your net worth at all times for the duration of the accounts, as measured every quarterly Call Report cycle. This means that regardless of how many CDAs you invest in, the combined book value of all such investments must not exceed 5 percent of your net worth. You must bring your aggregate accounts into compliance with the maximum aggregate funding limit within 30 days of any breach of this limit.

(ii) Segregated account. The assets of a CDA must be held in a segregated custodial account or special purpose entity and must be specifically identified as a CDA.

(iii) Regulatory oversight. If you choose to establish a CDA using a trust vehicle, the trustee must be regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), another federal regulatory agency, or a state financial regulatory agency. A regulated trustee or other person or entity that is authorized to make investment decisions for a CDA (manager), other than the credit union itself, must be either a Registered Investment Adviser or regulated by the OCC.

(iv) Account documentation and other written requirements. The parties to the CDA, typically the funding credit union and trustee or other manager of the account, must document the terms and conditions controlling the account in a written agreement. The terms of the agreement must be consistent with this section. Your board of directors must adopt written policies governing the creation, funding, and management of a CDA that are consistent with this section, must review the policies annually, and may amend them from time to time. Your CDA agreement and policies must at a minimum:

(A) Provide that the CDA will make charitable contributions and donations only to charities you name therein that are exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;

(B) Document the investment strategies and risk tolerances the CDA trustee or other manager must follow in administering the account;

(C) Provide that you will account for all aspects of the CDA, including distributions to charities and liquidation of the account, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and

(D) Indicate the frequency with which the trustee or manager of the CDA will make distributions to qualified charities as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section;

(v) Minimum distribution to charities. You are required to distribute to one or more qualified charities, no less frequently than every 5 years, and upon termination of a CDA regardless of the length of its term, a minimum of 51 percent of the account's total return on assets over the period of up to 5 years. Other than upon termination, you may choose how frequently CDA distributions to charity will be made during each period of up to 5 years. For example, you may choose to make periodic distributions over a period of up to 5 years, or only a single distribution as required at the end of that period. You may choose to donate in excess of the minimum distribution frequency and amount;

(vi) Liquidation of assets upon CDA termination. Upon termination of the CDA, you may receive a distribution of the remaining account assets in cash or you may receive a distribution in kind of the remaining account assets but only if those assets are permissible investments for federal credit unions under the Federal Credit Union Act and part 703 of this chapter; and

(vii) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

(A) Distribution in kind is your acceptance of remaining CDA assets, upon termination of the account, in their original form instead of in cash resulting from the liquidation of the assets.

(B) Qualified charity is a charitable organization or other non-profit entity recognized as exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

(C) Registered Investment Adviser is an investment adviser registered with the SEC pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

(D) Total return is the actual rate of return on all investments in a CDA over a given period of up to 5 years, including realized interest, capital gains, dividends, and distributions, but exclusive of account fees and expenses provided they were not paid to the credit union that established the CDA or to any of its affiliates.

(E) Affiliate is an entity in which the credit union has any ownership interest directly or indirectly. This would not apply to ownership due to the funding of employee benefits.
