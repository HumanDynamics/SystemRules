# Testing Startup & Operations Hypothesis for a Data-Driven Revolving Loan Fund

## Startup Hypothesis: 
* Using an Automated Business Platform, startup of revolving loan funds can be significatly simplified and streamlined.

### Potential Success Metrics: 

* Single, repeatable and customizable process can be used to start a new revolving loan fund
* Create complete, correct and authoritative data of all material activities for entire lifecycle of the fund
* Create traceable conformance of fund operation and fund purposes/objective (see StratML and other performance definition methods)

If parralel automated vs manual test:

* Significantly faster from start to launch using this process than current typical practices

* Less erroneous or mistaken information input by people forming the loan fund


### How will we test this: 
* As an initial PoC, at or near MIT in Nov/Dec 2016 we will attempt to form, fund and launch a revolving loan fund in a single sitting using integrated automation  

### Potential PoC Project Sketch 

* Simplest possible test project might be to form, capitalize and launch a fund with $1,000, 
* Use template that provides forms-driven application process with pull-down menu for requests of $250 loans.  
* Operation of fund would assess the applications and provide lending officers risk score and recommendation based on loan fund criteria and priorities and application would be accepted or loans approved
* Approval/Rejection decision entered to authoritative ledger
* Payback of $50/day in order to compose a one week loan lifecycle test
* Upon final payback or defaul of final loan, officers presented board motion to dissolve the company which, upon approval, sends dissolution to sec of state and conducts an asset transfer of any remaining funds to pre-designated recipient (perhaps the provider of initial capitalization or a suitable agreed socially alighed recipient)


### What tools, data or other resources do we need: 
We plan to use Valcu.co, AWS (or possibly Salesforce), Data Robot, Blockchain/Tieron, etc) and will require sufficient funds to capitalize the fund and pay the incorporation and other incidental expenses (eg web services). 

# Project Notes

* Providing clear rails for founders of new loan fund to identify key business, legal and technical aspects of their intended financial lending institution or program such that automated processes generate a "launch-ready" new fund.   
* Formation of a legal entity (short term: likely a Delaware LLC) that can enter contracts, sue and be sued, own a depository account to house loan funds and to make other payments (taxes & fees, web services, etc)...
* Set up the loan fund online with portal for applicants and borrowers, loan officers or staff, data and applications, financial accounting and systems logging, etc

### Operations Hypothesis: Using an Automated Business Platform, management and operations of revolving loan funds can be significatly simplified and streamlined.

* Anticipate significant increase in efficiency and effectiveness for loan fund based on reduced errors/delays and new access to 360 degree reporting/business intelligence about every aspect of governance, management, operations and other activities conducted by or with the loan fund

### Loan Origination Hypothesis: Using an Automated Business Platform, revolving loan funds loan origination can be significatly simplified and streamlined.

* Accuracy of risk assessment of loan applicant can be significantly improved based on application of social physics analysis of persmission shared personal data and other non-traditional credit indicators

* [Add additional factors here, perhaps ways to handle potential negative consequences for consumers, ways to improve loan servicing, etc]
