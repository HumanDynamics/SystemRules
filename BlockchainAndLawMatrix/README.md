For collaborative development of a matrix identifying correspondance between blockchain functionality and legal requirements.  

Essentially, the idea is to identify:

* Legally important capabilities of blockchain technology (eg immutability and public verifiability of log/ledger type entries,  permissionless/decentralized/distributed global computational network,  user-situated public/private key pairs with unique addresses for each individual, etc); and 

* Common, low-level legal requirements that are potentially addressable by blockchain capabilities (eg: for effective legal notices, for valid consent or digital signature procedures, for admissibility of records into evidence, for enforceable contractual terms, etc).

This collaboration is intended to reveal especially promising challenge-solution matches between blockchain technical capabilities and legal needs as a result of using a matrix structure to explore this inquiry from the ground up.
