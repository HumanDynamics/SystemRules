**The Lifecycle of Revolving Loan Funds from Inception to Successful Dissolution**

* Originally this information was created at: https://github.com/HumanDynamics/RevolvingLoanHack/wiki/Scope-of-Automation

The following processes, events and components may be in scope of the initial project to use DevOps for data-driven Revolving Loan Funds on blockchain


## BLT: Business, Legal and Technical Life-Cycle Integration

* **DOCKER**: Use docker image to containerize the entire entity, business processes and legal procedures of the loan fund
* **VALCU.co**: Use Valcu.co to automatically create a valid legal business entity (corp or llc) with Delaware Secretary of State (once incorporation is complete, extend this for grabbing the tax ID and creating bank account to hold the fund using API with selected depository institution)
* **Web Banking**: Use and integrated automated decision processes of the fund with the API selected partner bank to transact authorized web-based disbursals and repayments and pay routine expenses to operate the fund 
* **GitHub**: Use GitHub for the code and integrate AWS image of pre-configured template-base software that is customized by/for those starting up the loan fund
* **Cloud**: Use image of working instance of AWS/Rackspace/Azure/CloudFoundry/etc server, data stores, rules-engine (BPML 2), normalized/consistent platform & services and apps for loan officers, staff and auditors as well as for external web-based front-facing mobile app for loan application and notices to applicants or borrowers; authoritative single data store to drive the entire financial entity and enable breakthrough business intelligence and operations optimization; integrations with external payment, accounting, marketing and other key business or legal services; 
* **Blockchain for Identity**: Use ConsenSys' UPort, Blockstack or other available API-based service for locating individual or organizational unique identifiers and other identity attributes (this person has a KYC-verified account, that organization has over $50,000 in checking acct, confirm current postal address, etc)
* **Blockchain for Distributed Ledger**: Use Tierion, (blocksign, etc) to ensure proof of key transactional events (eg loan application as received; loan contract and terms as agreed; fact that a loan was successfully paid off, etc) by entering a hash of the relevant record(s) on the Bitcoin and/or Ethereum public blockchains and including reference to the address of that entry in the legal and business documents of or sent to the parties
* **Regulatory Filings**: Use government agency API interfaces to integrate timely and accurate reports, filings and other communications with regulatory, oversight, tax, permit/license providing; employee/hr or other governmental and private organizations with oversight authority

## Key RLF Processes:

* Establish lending criteria
* Pre-screen all applicants
* Underwrite all loans
* Serve as your lending staff
* Present to loan committee
* Prepare & execute loan documents
* Conduct loan closings
* Disburse loan funds
* Service the loan portfolio
* Monitor collateral
* File reports to the EDC

## Common Procedures and Parameters

* Purpose of program
* Geographic area served
* Committee composition
* Loan review criteria and approval process
* Financing policies (size, rate, term, fees)
* Sample Committee Composition
* Two members appointed by the city
* Two members appointed by the county commissioners
* Economic development and/or chamber representative
* One accountant or CPA
* Two from the private sector lending community
* Three representing the low-to-moderate income population

## Key Steps: Phasing and Staging


* Research existing RLFâ€™s and compile samples of application forms, program guidelines, and other materials.
* Invite lenders and potential borrowers to participate in the design process.
* Establish the purpose of the RLF. This should include a needs assessment.
* Set the eligibility requirements for borrowers.
* Determine the allowed uses of funds as well as prohibited uses.
* Set a minimum and maximum amount for the loans.
* Decide if the loans must be matched by existing equity or other sources of funds.
* Determine the length of the loan term, which may vary based on the use of the loan. For example, the term for a loan to purchase equipment may be based on the life of the product while a loan for real estate may have a 15-year term.
* Establish an application fee, origination fee, and policies regarding closing costs. Define the default and delinquency terms.
* Decide if the interest rate will be variable or fixed and whether the rate will vary based on the project.
* Develop the loan application form. Create a short pre-application form or checklist to help borrowers determine if they are eligible.
* Set up a committee to review loan applications.
* Determine the administrative duties and staffing needs associated with the program.
* Promote the RLF and capitalize with funds from grants and individual donations.
* Provide loans and technical assistance to borrowers.

## Common RLF Initial & Continuing Capitalization Sources

* SBA 7(a) Community Advantage Program, 
* SBA Intermediary Lending Program (ILP)
* SBA Microloan Program
* USDA Intermediary Relending Program (IRP)
* USDA Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program (RMAP)
* US Treasury Community Development Loan Fund (CDLF) program
* Inter-American Development Fund
* Etc, etc
