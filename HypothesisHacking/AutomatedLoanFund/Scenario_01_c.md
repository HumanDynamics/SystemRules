**1) Scenario: Dakota/2017

**2) Hypothesis: Working with Bank of Dakota we believe that we can design a more efficient way to disburse and track loans going to entrepreneurs and start ups in the state ( i didnt focus on personal data here because they didnt seem to have a problem with choosing who they were giving loans out to)

**3) Testing: we can test the new process time against old processing time to compare transparency / efficiency of the RFL

**4) Desired Results: We hope to build a more transparent and efficient way for the bank to dispurse loans to entrepreneurs
