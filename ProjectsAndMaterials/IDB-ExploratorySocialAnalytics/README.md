# Sketch of Ideas for Social Analytics Collaboration with IDB 

**Followup on the idea to attempt exploratory analysis of the large scale survey instrument IDB team discussed at MIT Media Lab brainstorm session**

## Notes

* As an initial followup, it would probably be most appropriate to inquire if they would be up for something like this and if so, we could offer to send a short writeup of some of the questions we're interested to try answering by doing some rapid, creative analysis (hacking it!).  I don't mind writing a draft of that and circulating it to both of you as a way to get a quick start on this.  One dumb question: Can one of you please remind me of the specific name of the survey?

* Some thoughts:  I'm not sure whether we could get access to the actual, full data or if some de-identification or aggregation would be needed before we could look at it.  Assuming we were able to have authorization to work on the primary data, it seems to me that once it was wrangled and loaded into our favorite packages and libraries some novel patterns may be revealed and we may gain fresh insights into other ways to analyze the data.  It is ok if no valuable outputs result from truly exploratory data science, but I suspect this sort of collaborative hack may yield actionable ideas for how this data could be leveraged to assess effectiveness of past IDB funded programs or potential ways to get more value from this survey instrument by incorporating it into success measures of future IDB programs or by slightly evolving the survey to include more digital information (eg box to check if interested to receive text for digital part of survey or to get followup on future programs using smart phone app).
