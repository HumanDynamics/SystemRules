# Legal Documentation Automation for Start-ups and Entrepreneurs

* Who: Jonathan Askin, ... 
* Where: Brooklyn Law School, University of Amsterdam 
* Blurb: This project will focus on 3D Printing Global Code of Conduct (as emblematic of international collaboration). It will draw upon semantic systems and deep learning for the creation and automation of Global Standards, Principles, MoUs, Codes of Conduct) (e.g., Creative Commons, W3C, GSM MoU, IP MoU, eMagnaCarta, others?)
The University of Amsterdam and Brooklyn Law School students have been building a global Code of Conduct for Digital Manufacturing (aka, 3D printing) and a crowd-sourced global wiki of the various nation-specific laws governing the emerging industry.
* Problem Solved: Nefarious Applications and Inconsistent Surrounding 3D Printing Policies  
* Solution: Global Crowdsourced Wiki and Proposed Uniform Principles 
* GLTL MIT Event Track: Semantic Systems 

Legal Technology Application Area: Legal document automation
Project Status: Extended development/prototyping stage
This project will see the further development and integration of Tony Luppino’s Founders’ Terms Sheet generator tool for start-ups in initial formation/pre-venture capital stage and Larry Farmer’s & Jeff Ward’s LLC Formation tool. This will be established as a Start-up Advisor Toolkit to serve as both an efficient means for the delivery of high-quality legal services in company formation, and as the means for data collection across transactional law clinics.
Founder’s Term Sheet Generator Tool (Tony Luppino): An interactive suite of tools originated by Tony Luppino and refined with student teams from the interdisciplinary and inter-institution Law, Technology & Public Policy course at UMKC (UMKC Course) to assist individuals who want to start a new business, and their legal counsel, with education on pivotal issues, information assembly and the generation of a “founders’ terms sheet” to facilitate a proper choice of entity for the business and appropriate terms and conditions of the business relationship between/among the company founders, and utilize the terms sheet to electronically produce a first draft of key company organizational documents.
LLC Formation Tool (Larry Farmer and Jeff Ward): The LLC Formation tool has been continually developed and enhanced over a 15-year period for application in the state of Utah. It includes checklists, templates, transmittal letters and other supporting documents to support a range of state-specific company formation requirements. More recently, work has been undertaken to adapt the LLC Formation Tool for deployment in North Carolina and the establishment of online access.
