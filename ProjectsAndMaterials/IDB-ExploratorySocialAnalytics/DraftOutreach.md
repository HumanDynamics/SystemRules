Dear Rafael,

It was a pleasure seeing you again at the Media Lab and great meeting the IDB team working on health related programs!

Following up on the lunch brainstorming session, I had a great conversation with Media Lab  postdocs  Andres Abeliuk and Pablo Ega√±a del Sol about potential ways we could better understand and gain new insights from the survey instrument discussed at the lunch meeting.

Would it be possible to open a discussion with relevant people at IDB about potential analytics we could perform on data derived from that survey? Depending on what data we could gain access to, high level inquiries could be to:

Identify and test ways to assess effectiveness of past IDB funded programs in new ways and postulate potential methods to get more value from this survey instrument by incorporating it into success measures of future IDB programs; and

Identify opportunities to leverage the existing data by slightly evolving the survey in order to include more digital information (eg box to check if interested to receive text for digital part of survey or to get followup on future programs using smart phone app).

Please let us know if this is something that would be of interest and we'd be happy to have an initial conversation and/or write up something more substantive as a next step.

Warmly,

Dazza, Pablo and Andres
