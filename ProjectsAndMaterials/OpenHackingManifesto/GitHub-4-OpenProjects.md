# What is Git and GitHub?

A: 

# When I Fork a Repo, How Do I Keep in Sync With the Project I Forked From?

A: On GitHub using the Web Interface:

* Step 1 Go to your fork.
* Step 2 Issue a Pull Request. By default this will be your fork on the right (head repo) requesting to push its commits and changes to the original repo (base repo) on the left.
* Step 3 Click the drop down for both base repo and head repo and select each other's repos. ...
* Step 4 Send the pull request.
