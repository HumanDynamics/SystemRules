# Digital Manufacturing Standards (3D Printing)

* Who: Jonathan Askin, ... 
* Where: Brooklyn Law School, University of Amsterdam 
* Blurb: This project will focus on 3D Printing Global Code of Conduct (as emblematic of international collaboration). It will draw upon semantic systems and deep learning for the creation and automation of Global Standards, Principles, MoUs, Codes of Conduct) (e.g., Creative Commons, W3C, GSM MoU, IP MoU, eMagnaCarta, others?)
The University of Amsterdam and Brooklyn Law School students have been building a global Code of Conduct for Digital Manufacturing (aka, 3D printing) and a crowd-sourced global wiki of the various nation-specific laws governing the emerging industry.
* Problem Solved: Nefarious Applications and Inconsistent Surrounding 3D Printing Policies  
* Solution: Global Crowdsourced Wiki and Proposed Uniform Principles 
* GLTL MIT Event Track: Semantic Systems
