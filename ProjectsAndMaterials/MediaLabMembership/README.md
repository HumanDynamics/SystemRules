# MIT Media Lab Membership

So, you are interested in Lab membership! As you may or may not know, we have a unique style of interaction with member companies that is quite different from most academic collaborations. One aspect of this is an antidisciplinary, undirected research program made up of 25 research groups working on more than 350 projects. To facilitate this free, creative environment, the Lab has a shared-IP model--all member companies have equal access to IP generated during their period of membership. While no exclusive IP is given to any one member company, individual companies may–and do–take research out of the Lab for further development.

This membership model offers access to a tremendous range of research–to new ideas, cross-collaboration with upstream and downstream companies, and participation in a community of iconoclastic, innovative, active thinkers.

At the moment we have two levels of membership. Our base level membership would be a consortium member, for $250K a year with a three year agreement. This membership would give you access to: all research at the lab, visiting privileges, access to students for recruitment, invitations to Media Lab events and workshops, among many other benefits. Our second level is a consortium research member for $450K a year with a three year agreement. This level essentially provides you all the benefits of a consortium member, with the added benefit of an employee-in-residence at the Lab.
