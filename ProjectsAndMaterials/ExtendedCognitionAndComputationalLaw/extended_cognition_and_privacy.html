<p>This was a Google Sheet online spreadsheet file that was populated with data from an online form for informally proposed project ideas. Notably, the form captured an idea from Jeffrey Vagle, of upenn.edu on &quot;Proposed new project: Extended cognition and (constitutional and common law) privacy&quot; which became a project session at the post-event Legal Hackathon hosted by MIT/law at the Media Lab. The-Future-of-Extended-Cognition-and-Law.md</p>
<p>These notes cover a post event session on &quot;Proposed new project: Extended cognition and (constitutional and common law) privacy&quot; This project was worked on by several people in collaboration with Jeff Vagle at the MIT Media Lab during a mini-legal hackathon immediately following the LTL event. The original notes file on the Extended Cognition session can be found at: https://github.com/HumanDynamics/law.MIT.edu/wiki/The-Future-of-Extended-Cognition-and-Law (also copied into this directory]</p>

<li><p>(Dazza) &quot;Extended Cognition&quot; is not yet a broadly defined term - what should the definition or options for the definition be? How do we know when it is happening or not?</p></li>
<li><p>(Dazza) Is it true that we are at a major inflection point with AI generally and that there are imminently going to be profound changes that will pose significant challenges to law and many other fields? EG: The motivation for this White House initiative suggest this is a factor: (https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/05/03/preparing-future-artificial-intelligence). (JEF) We are certainly entering a golden age for pattern matching. A lot of long-term research endeavors in this area are starting to come to fruition in a lot of different industrial domains (deepmind, self-driving cars, etc.) (JEF) I am skeptical that we will see profound changes. I think the trends we've seen for years are going to accelerate, but the change will be gradual. These advances make great headlines...</p></li>

<li><p>The fourth and fifth amendments seem to distinguish between human &quot;data&quot; (artifacts that can be searched) and &quot;code&quot; (internal cognition that has protection from self-incrimination). The fundamental question is whether &quot;extended cognition&quot; in the form of technical systems that assist human cognition (learning systems) or that physically extend it (implants?) are &quot;data&quot; (subject to fourth amendment search) or &quot;code&quot; (protected from self-incrimination by the fifth amendment).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Levels of &quot;extended cognition&quot;: * Physically part of your brain or attached to your brain. * Interacting with your internal cognitive thought processes. * A feedback loop. The system learns about you, makes suggestions, and you act on them, thereby generating new data for learning. * A learning system. The system learns about you and makes inferences.</p>
<p>Thought experiment: You are a drug dealer. You typically deal drugs at a particular intersection. Google Now learns this intersection and consistently suggests directions to this location. Does this qualify as cognition? Does it receive fifth amendment protection, or is it subject to fifth amendment search? What if Google doesn't learn initially, but starts making suggestions about good locations to deal drugs that you tend to follow, thereby creating a feedback loop?</p>
<p>(JLV): My thinking of &quot;extended cognition&quot; is generally in line with Andy Clark's concepts along these lines. Specifically, this is not necessarily a sci-fi or exotic concept of a brain implant, but can manifest in much more prosaic ways. For example, technological memory aids, geospatial reasoning, etc. A key question that I think might help decide whether we're talking about extended cognition or not is whether or not the technology has given rise to a &quot;coupled system.&quot; That is, all components in the system (internal or external) play an active role in the cognitive process, and the removal of the technology results in a decrease in cognitive ability. These concepts are not mine, but those that have been around for some time in the area of externalism over the past few decades (see, e.g., Putnam).</p>
<p>(JLV): For the above reason, I think the advances we are seeing (and have seen) in what could be characterized as a couple system, are many. Possibilities may be found in vehicle automation (not just self-driving but think of navigation and trip scheduling); home automation; algorithmic policing; etc.</p>
